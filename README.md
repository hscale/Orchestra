# Orchestra

&#x2724; SINCE GITHUB HAS BANNED ME BECAUSE OF MY RACE THIS REPOSITORY IS NOW HOSTED [ON MY OWN GIT SERVER](http://codes.kary.us/orchestra/hall) &#x2724;

Orchestra is a visual language that compiles into RegExp (as for ECMAScript.). It's replacement for the existing syntax of Regular Expressions and tries to build upon that a better language so  developers can do more powerful stuff while having less pain.
